# Collaboration Guide

## Working Together

This guide was created collaboratively to help teams work effectively together.

### Pair Programming Best Practices

1. **Driver-Navigator Pattern**
   - One person writes code (driver)
   - Other person reviews and guides (navigator)
   - Switch roles regularly (every 30 minutes)

2. **Co-authored Commits**
   - Use `Co-authored-by` in commit messages
   - Ensures both contributors get credit
   - Tracks collaboration in GitHub

3. **Communication**
   - Keep video/audio on during sessions
   - Ask questions freely
   - Share knowledge openly

### Code Review Guidelines

- Review code within 24 hours
- Provide constructive feedback
- Test changes locally when possible
- Approve or request changes promptly

## Tools

- Use the `collab-helper.sh` script for co-authored commits
- Enable branch protection for important branches
- Use draft PRs for work-in-progress
